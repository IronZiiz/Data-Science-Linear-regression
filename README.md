## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**  
This repository is your go-to resource for mastering **linear regression**, a cornerstone of statistical modeling and machine learning. Designed for beginners, it combines theory with practical coding exercises to help you:  
- Understand the math behind linear relationships.  
- Build, interpret, and validate regression models.  
- Apply your knowledge to real-world problems.

## **Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this course, you will be able to:  
1. **Identify** linear trends in data.  
2. **Distinguish** between independent (explanatory) and dependent (response) variables.  
3. **Fit a regression model** using Python and libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.  
4. **Interpret coefficients** (slope and intercept) to explain variable relationships.  
5. **Evaluate model fit** using RÂ² and diagnose potential issues.  
6. **Predict outcomes** for new data points.

## ðŸ“š **Course Outline**  
### 1. **Introduction to Linear Relationships**  
   - What is a linear relationship?  
   - Scatterplots and correlation analysis.  

### 2. **Variables in Regression**  
   - Explanatory vs. Response Variables.  
   - Feature and target selection.  

### 3. **Model Building**  
   - Equation of a line: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$.  
   - Least squares method for fitting.  

### 4. **Model Interpretation**  
   - Slope ($\beta_1$): "For every unit increase in X, Y changes by...".  
   - Intercept ($\beta_0$): Baseline value.  

### 5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - RÂ²: Proportion of variance explained.  
   - Residual analysis: Checking assumptions.  

### 6. **Predictions & Applications**  
   - Using the model for forecasting.  
   - Case study: Predicting house prices.
